A simple and clear project that builds, trains, and evaluates a neural network to classify 
handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset with TensorFlow/Keras.


# Project Overview

This repository contains code to:
- Load the prebuilt MNIST dataset.
- Preprocess and normalize images.
- Build a Keras `Sequential` neural network (Flatten → Dense → Dropout → Dense).
- Train the model and visualize training/validation accuracy and loss.
- Evaluate the model on test data and show example predictions.

# Features
- Simple, beginner-friendly implementation.
- Training/validation curves visualization.
- Example of making predictions and visualizing the result.
- Clean project structure suitable for extension (e.g., replace with CNN, augmentations).
